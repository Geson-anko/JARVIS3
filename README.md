# History
*--intro--*  
Our theory of J.A.R.V.I.S. is created by me and Kazuya Ohyanagi in summer 2020.  
We definded the "Thinking" as to connect and track a memory to other memory.
So J.A.R.V.I.S. theory produce the modeling of "Thinking" or the brain.  
  
“J.A.R.V.I.S. “ I made is very large AutoEncoder. So it isn’t completely and its object is NOT to solve problems.
